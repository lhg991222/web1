Trump has declared all over the United States to ‘stay-at-home’ for
the American people. The goal of the policy is to reduce the spread of
COVID19 by reducing contacts among Americans.<br> However, such a curfew would
naturally lead to a slowdown in the U.S. economy as it would reduce its
economic activity.<br><br> So the U.S. government put forward its economic
normalization policy plan called ‘Opening up America Again’.

 normal life should only be tolerated by the American people.</p><p>Trump is
 demanding commitment from the American people by giving them
 the task of boosting the economy instead of quelling fear and anxiety
